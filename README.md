* [cite_start]**Automation:** Reduced manual data entry time by 60% through automated workflows[cite: 91].
* [cite_start]**Scale:** Optimized to handle metadata extraction for 10,000+ components with <1s latency[cite: 84].
* [cite_start]**User Reach:** Architected to support 300+ concurrent users in a manufacturing environment[cite: 89].

## Technical Stack
* [cite_start]**Frontend:** React, Three.js (Industrial Dashboards)[cite: 31, 38].
* [cite_start]**Backend:** Node.js, FastAPI[cite: 20, 88].
* [cite_start]**Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) with RBAC[cite: 21, 90].
